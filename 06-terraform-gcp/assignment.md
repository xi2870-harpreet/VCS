1. Use the terminal to create Compute instance Compute network(VPC)  by Terraform:
2. First run ```terraform init``` to initialize the working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
4. Now run ```terraform validate```  to validates the configuration files in a directory.
5. Now run ```terraform plan```  which creates an execution plan, which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to your infrastructure
6. Now run ```terraform apply``` to provision the resources

 Congratulations!! now Compute instance/Compute network(VPC) resources has been provisioned successfully.
